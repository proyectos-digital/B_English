                        <p class="ta-c"><i>A new study finds that horror is the only film genre where women appear and speak as often as men</i>.</p>
                        <p class="ta-c">Beth Younger posted Jul 18, 2017</p>
                        <p class="ta-j"><strong>1</strong> At the end of this year’s Cannes Film Festival, actress Jessica Chastain—who was
                          serving as a jury member—said that she found the portrayals of women in the festival’s
                          films “quite disturbing.”<br/>
                          To many, this isn’t exactly news. The lack of women in film—in front of and behind the
                          camera—has been at the center of Hollywood criticism in recent years, with scholars and
                          writers detailing the ways women tend to be underrepresented or cast in stereotypical roles.<br/><br/>
                          <strong>2</strong> University of Southern California
                          communications professor Stacy Smith, who
                          researches depictions of gender and race in
                          film and TV, found that of the 5,839 characters
                          in the 129 top-grossing films released between
                          <img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" src="unit_2/module_8/assets/images/test_1_1.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                          2006 and 2011, fewer than 30 percent were
                          girls or women. Meanwhile, only 50 percent
                          of films fulfill the criteria of the Bechdel Test,
                          which asks whether a film features at least
                          two women who talk to each other about
                          something other than a man.<br/>
                          Despite the uphill climb for women in film, it
                          isn’t all doom and gloom. Horror is one genre
                          where women are taking on increasingly
                          prominent parts. Yes, screaming is still a staple
                          
                          
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col xs12 md6">
                        <p class="ta-j"><img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" src="unit_2/module_8/assets/images/test_1_2.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                          of a scary flick. But women are assuming
                          central roles—not as victims, but as monsters
                          and heroes.<br/><br/>
                          <strong>3 Bucking the trend</strong><br/>
                          Each year, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender
                          and Media publishes research that shows how
                          gender imbalance in film affects women and girls.
                          For example, they’ve found that positive and
                          prominent roles for women in movies “motivate
                          women to be more ambitious” professionally
                          and personally. But when there is a dearth of
                          women being depicted in positive ways, it has
                          an opposite, negative effect.<br/>
                          A recent study by Google and the Geena Davis
                          Institute studied this phenomenon across genres. They developed something called
                          “the GD-IQ” (Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient), which is facilitated by machine-learning
                          technology. The goal was to recognize patterns in gender, screen time and speaking
                          time that the casual movie viewer might overlook. The results of this study told a
                          familiar story: In film, men are seen and heard twice as often as women. But there was
                          one exception: horror films.<br/><br/>
                          <strong>4 A horror renaissance</strong><br/>
                          In a way, this makes sense. A recent Guardian article describes how women have
                          historically been drawn to the genre. Many beloved horror films have strong female
                          leads: Carrie, The Descent, and The Witch, to name a few.<br/>
                          Horror, of course, has always been interested in women; traditionally, women and girls
                          are victims of crazed killers or of monsters. They scream a lot.<br/>
                          Yet the terms have changed along with the times, and a horror renaissance seems to
                          have been taking place over the past decade.

                          The genre has moved from taking pleasure in victimizing women to focusing on women
                          as survivors and protagonists. It has veered away from slashers and torture porn
                          to more substantive, nuanced films that comment on social issues and possess an
                          aesthetic vision.<br/>
                          Earlier this year, Jordan Peele’s Get Out became a major box-office smash; as it skewered
                          racial politics, it also made a beautiful, young white woman the evil antagonist. In 2015,
                          Robert Egger’s historical horror film The Witch was a surprise hit. With a 91 percent
                          fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, The Witch captured audiences by being a historically
                          accurate tale that included a feminist twist. Set in Puritan America, a teenage protagonist,
                          Thomasin, battles her parents and siblings, who assume she’s become a witch, faulting
                          her for all the misfortunes that befall the family. Of course, she’s simply a teenage girl—a
                          dangerous creature, the film seems to be saying, in a culture controlled by men.
                          Get Out and The Witch join a host of other horror films with women as central characters:
                          Stoker, Under the Skin, Rec, The Conjuring, Ginger Snaps, American Mary, Jennifer’s Body, and
                          You’re Next.<br/><br/>
