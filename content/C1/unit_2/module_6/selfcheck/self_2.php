                          The Colorado River, one of the longest rivers in the United States, is gradually shrinking.
                          This is partly a result of overuse by municipalities and seasonal drought. The other
                          reason is global warming. The decline in the river reservoir will have serious implications
                          for large U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, that depend on the Colorado River as their
                          water source. In addition, this will also affect the Native American tribes who view the
                          Colorado River as sacred to their religions. The U.S. government made certain Native
                          American religious practices illegal in the 19th and early 20th century. As Ka-Voka
                          Jackson, a member of the Hualapai tribe and a

                          Colorado River is so sacred not just to my tribe,
                          but to so many others.” As a scholar of Native
                          American religions and the environment, I
                          understand how indigenous people’s religions
                          and sacred places are closely tied to their
                          landscape. For the past 100 years, indigenous
                          peoples have been forced to adapt to changes
                          in their environments and modify their
                          religious rituals in the United States. The U.S.
                          government made certain Native American
                          religious practices illegal in the 19th and early

                          20th century. Although these policies have since been rescinded, they led to changes
                          in many indigenous practices.<br/>
                          Global warming, however, is different. The question is whether indigenous people will
                          be able to adapt their beliefs all over again amid the impact of global warming on the
                          natural world.<br/><br/>
                          <strong>Adapting to change</strong><br/>
                          The Blackfeet tribe in Montana changed their relationship with the natural world as a
                          result of the policies of the U.S. government from the 1880s to the 1930s.
                          For example, the Blackfeet purposefully moved religious ceremonies from one time
                          on their liturgical calendar to completely different times to avoid the U.S. government
                          penalizing native people for dancing or participating in religious ceremonies.
                          The Blackfeet moved their annual O’kan, or Sundance festival, from late summer (usually
                          held at the end of August) to the Fourth of July celebration. They avoided U.S. government
                          punishment by masking their ceremonies within state-sanctioned public events.
                          Native American tribes learned to adapt to the challenges placed before them.
                          Policies related to the mining of natural resources and damming of rivers on indigenous
                          lands have also led to changes in Native Americans’ religious practices.
                          Historian David R. M. Beck Interviewed elders and researched how the Menominee
                          tribe in Wisconsin adapted to the loss of their sacred fish, the sturgeon, after a paper
                          mill built a dam across the Wolf River.
                          The sturgeon disappeared after the dam was built in 1892, because they could no
                          longer swim upstream to spawn. For more than 100 years, the Menominee tribal
                          members continued to pray and conduct their annual “returning of the sturgeon”
                          ceremony in the spring—even though no more sturgeon were in the river. The
                          Menominee ultimately won the right to return the sturgeon to the Wolf River in 1992,
                          and the tribe revitalized the full ceremony and celebration of their sacred fish.
                          In all these situations, Native American tribes learned to adapt to the challenges placed
                          before them, modify their religious practice and embrace a different relationship with
                          the natural world.

                          <strong>Global</strong> climate change affects everyone, not just specific groups in specific places. But
                          for many indigenous peoples, natural resources are <strong>closely linked</strong> to religious beliefs
                          and practices.<br/>
                          Historically, indigenous peoples used the natural seasonal cycles of weather, plants and
                          animals as part of their liturgical or religious calendar. The Blackfeet held their <strong>annual</strong>
                          “beaver bundle ceremony” in the early spring as ice melted off rivers and beavers
                          returned to the open waters. In Blackfeet mythology, a beaver served as a <strong>deity</strong> who
                          taught humans how to <strong>cultivate</strong> tobacco, which the tribe used for important religious
                          ceremonies and as a peace offering to their enemies.<br/>
                          There are signs, though, that beavers are now moving north because of global warming.
                          Biologists are <strong>currently</strong> studying both beavers and the birch and alder shrubs that
                          beavers eat, as both move north into new regions. Scientists worry that as a keystone
                          species, the movement of beavers will change the northern ecosystems as they cut off
                          waterways and build beaver dams. And shrubs
                          will change the local waterways that they grow
                          by. This will affect local animal species.<br/>
                          What will happen when there is no more

                          beaver in Blackfeet territory? Will their religious
                          traditions adapt similar to the Menominee when
                          they faced the loss of their sacred sturgeon?<br/><br/>
                          <strong> Religion and resiliency</strong>
                          From the arctic tundra to the American desert
                          southwest, and places worldwide, indigenous
                          peoples will be facing the impact of global
                          climate change.<br/>
                          Regarding the shrinking of the Colorado
                          River, researchers Brad Udall and Jonathan

                          Overpeck have concluded that, “Failing to act
                          on climate change means accepting the very
                          high risk that the Colorado River basin will
                          continue to dry up into the future.”<br/>
                          If this river faces a drier future, it will likely
                          affect the Mojave, a people indigenous to the
                          Colorado River basin, who believe the river
                          was created by their ancient deity Mastamho
                          as part of their sacred landscape.<br/>
                          While last week’s G-20 summit in Germany
                          covered global issues including climate
                          change, indigenous scholars, such as myself,
                          are wondering what the future holds for
                          indigenous peoples, their environments and
                          their religions.<br/>
                          Indigenous communities can be resilient and adapt their internal religious beliefs to
                          outside challenges, as Native American tribes from the turn of the 20th century have
                          proven. Climate change presents yet another challenge.<br/><br/>
