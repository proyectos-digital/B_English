                          Even as federal sponsorship of the National Endowment for the Arts hangs in the
                          balance, people are responding to the Trump administration by turning to the arts
                          more and more as a means of resistance. From the energy behind the Pussyhat Project
                          to feminist punk anthems, art is at the forefront of the public’s defiance.<br/><br/>
                          If the past few weeks have been any indication, the progressive agenda over next four
                          years will be hard-won—and heavily illustrated.<br/><br/>
                          While the Trump administration makes its
                          way through its first 100 days, a grassroots
                          coalition of designers called the Creative
                          Action Network (CAN) is illustrating its own
                          <img class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10" src="unit_3/module_10/assets/images/test_1_1.png" alt="" align="left"/>
                          version of what makes America great in a
                          collection of 100 posters called “What Makes
                          America Great.” CAN is releasing one poster a
                          day as a direct counter to President Trump’s
                          campaign slogan.<br/><br/>
                          “Right after the election, we started hearing
                          from lots of our artists: ‘What are we going to
                          do?’” said Max Slavkin, CAN co-founder and
                          CEO. “Everyone was so shocked and upset by
                          
                          
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col xs12 md6">
                        <p class="ta-j"><img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" src="unit_3/module_10/assets/images/test_1_2.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                          what had happened, for a while we weren’t
                          totally sure. We knew we didn’t want to do
                          something as simple as anti-Donald Trump
                          art because it felt like there was a unique
                          opportunity for art to go a little deeper than
                          that.”<br/><br/>
                          Slavkin helped found CAN in 2008 as a
                          way for artists to support themselves while
                          producing work for causes they care about.
                          CAN puts out a call for art around a cause,
                          then licenses work from artists to sell as
                          merchandise. After the illustrators take their
                          cut, a portion of the profit is contributed to a
                          charity relevant to the campaign.<br/><br/>
                          Launched on Inauguration Day, CAN’S “What Makes America Great” campaign highlights
                          traits like religious freedom, immigration, and resilience as hallmarks of American
                          values.<br/><br/>
                          “When times get hard, we persevere,” illustrator Emily Kelley said about her poster. “Our
                          resilience is what makes us come back stronger than ever. It’s what makes us keep going,
                          and it’s what will keep us from never giving up. Resilience is what makes America great.”
                          “America was built by immigrants and their descendants,” artist Chris Lozos said.<br/><br/>
                          “Those who came here had the spirit to overcome great obstacles and the ambition
                          to fulfill their dreams in a new world. Without this steady stream of pioneers during all
                          eras, we would not be the proud nation we are today.”

                            David Hays said about his design. “This insight
                            is at least four centuries old, formulated
                            by philosopher Francis Bacon during the
                            Enlightenment. Though we now head into a
                            new Dark Age in which Republicans intend to
                            unwind eight years of hard-fought social and
                            economic progress, the statement has lost
                            nothing in terms of relevance and significance:
                            Knowledge is more powerful than ever … and
                            education is the fundamental precondition
                            for political development, democracy, and
                            social justice.”<br/><br/>
