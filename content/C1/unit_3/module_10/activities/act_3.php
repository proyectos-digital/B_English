                    <p class="ta-c">Dee Axelrod posted Feb 19, 2006</p>
                    <p class="ta-j">While the last 10 years have seen the <strong>weakening</strong> of funding to individual artists and
                      the end of many alternative venues for showing art, a global art scene is thriving. The
                      <strong>broadening</strong> and democratization of mainstream art, largely driven by the Internet, has
                      helped reshape the aesthetic landscape from a New York-centric, gallery-driven scene
                      to a thriving online global arts community.<br/>
                      In 1995, <strong>widespread</strong> access to the Internet produced a <strong>dazzling</strong> explosion of
                      opportunities for artists to connect with <strong>practitioners</strong> from all over the world.
                      Suddenly, in a single afternoon, an artist could “visit” a Prague printshop, view the Cone
                      sisters' collection of early Modernist works at
                      the Baltimore Museum, chat with a collective
                      of feminist artists in New Zealand, submit
                      work to an abundance of shows worldwide—
                      or show and sell from her own website.<br/><br/>

                      The Internet has created not just virtual art spaces but new opportunities for showing
                      physical art in the real world, giving new scope to DIY (do it yourself) ingenuity. A traveling
                      exhibit, for example, that would once have been organized by <strong>curators</strong> might now be
                      artist-created and controlled—and feature works from all over the world.<br/><br/>
                      One such show, organized online, opened in Milwaukee in 2001, featuring mixed
                      media works ranging from Chicago artist Carlos Cortez' woodcut posters for Industrial
                      Workers of the World (I.W.W.) to <strong>Beehive</strong> Design Collective artists Kehban Grifter and
                      Juan Manchu's images in collaboration with several Colombian communities. By August
                      2005, the exhibit had been shown in 27 cities and traveled more than 25,000 miles,
                      aided by a website, www.drawingresistance.org, that became a virtual gathering place.
                      “Drawing Resistance” depended on publicity and <strong>fund</strong>-raising from each local venue.

                      The capacity to stay connected online has helped power a healthy diaspora of artists to
                      places besides New York, just as the Internet emphasis on communication has encouraged
                      artists toward collective art activities that make an end run around market influences.
                      It has also encouraged new forms of arts education. The Beehive Collective (www.
                      beehivecollective.org), an ongoing, decentralized collaboration of anonymous “bees,”
                      has made it its mission “to <strong>cross-pollinate</strong> the <strong>grassroots”</strong> by producing images
                      that anyone is free to take and use. Among other projects, the “hive” delivers some 200
                      lectures per year on globalization and promotes collaborations between the visual and
                      literary arts.<br/>
                      Community arts programs—curricula for teaching a more socially engaged art—
                      emerged at such campuses as the Institute for Social Ecology and Goddard College,
                      both in Plainfield, Vermont. A group of 60 “eco artists” who gathered at the 1998 College
                      Art Association meeting in L.A. formed an ongoing network of artists concerned with
                      preserving and <strong>restoring</strong> the natural world.<br/>
                      One such project, completed in June 2005, is “Three Rivers Second Nature”—an
                      analysis of three river systems and 53 streams
                      of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania initiated
                      by Carnegie Mellon University's Studio
                      for Creative Inquiry. A team of artists and
                      researchers, headed by Tim Collins and Reiko
                      <img class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10 " src="unit_3/module_10/assets/images/act_3_3.png" alt="" align="left"/>
                      Goto, synthesized information gathered from
                      historians, landscape architects, geographic
                      information systems specialists, botanists,
                      engineers, and water-policy experts to map
                      the region's natural history, analyze water
                      use, and consider stream restoration. On
                      completion of the project, the team presented
                      their findings to the public.<br/>
                      <strong>Meanwhile</strong>, the traditional <strong>notion</strong> of public
                      art—a discrete object made without much

                    <p class="ta-j">
                      consideration for a particular place—has undergone a transformation that reflects
                      artists' deepening understanding of what it means to work in community. Artists first
                      began to take into account the history and ecology of a particular site in the early 1970s.
                      A natural next step was to consult with community members, perhaps <strong>eliciting</strong> their
                      ideas and even some contributions. Over the last decade, a public art has emerged that
                      seeks to place the creative process <strong>wholly</strong> in the hands of the community, with the
                      artist in the role of facilitator, helping to draw forth a community's stories. Community
                      has been defined broadly to include such marginalized groups as <strong>inmates</strong> and <strong>shelter</strong>
                      <strong>inhabitants</strong>.<br/>
                      But of all recent developments, it may be the emergence of artist-activists in their 20s
                      that is most exciting. A different <strong>breed</strong> from past art school graduates competing to
                      become “art stars,” these young people make art in service to social change. They do
                      “reclamation art” projects at degraded sites. They help create dialogue among polarized
                      groups. They work to foster a sense of community. They are the hopeful future of art.
