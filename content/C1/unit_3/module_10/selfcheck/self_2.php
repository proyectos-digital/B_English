                        <p class="ta-c">Arlene Goldbard posted Nov 11, 2015</p>
                        <p class="ta-j">
                          Imagine if U.S. policy looked like this: A universal, publicly funded Basic Income Grant
                          (BIG) covered economic needs, benefiting every person equally; and Cultural Impact
                          Studies (CIS), analogous to environmental impact studies, assessed the potential
                          impacts of proposed development on our cultural fabric. This public policy would value
                          the sense of belonging, sites of public memory, gathering places, and expressions of
                          heritage cultures that would be destroyed when a longstanding neighborhood is razed
                          to make way for a new freeway or sports stadium.<br/><br/>
                          These are just two of the cultural policy proposals featured in the U.S. Department of
                          Arts and Culture’s recently published An Act of Collective Imagination: The USDAC’s First
                          Two Years of Action Research. As “Chief Policy Wonk,” I coordinate the National Cabinet
                          and authored the report. We like to say the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture is the
                          nation’s first people-powered department. It’s not a government agency—it’s not even
                          affiliated with government— but a national action network mobilizing artists, cultural
                          workers, and other community members to use creativity for social justice. We’re trying
                          to spark a creative, grassroots movement that engages millions of people in enacting a
                          world rooted in empathy, equity, and social imagination. Using arts-based methods, we
                          invite people to envision the future they want to inhabit, and create projects to realize
                          their visions.<br/><br/>
                          An Act of Collective Imagination puts forward six cultural policy ideas grounded in
                          grassroots visions, including BIG and CIS. Two key considerations shaped the report:
                          linking local and national concerns and organizing; proposing policies that emerge from
                          people’s lived knowledge rather than from distanced expertise; and promoting a broad
                          public interest in culture, too often dismissed as a special-interest frill.
                          
                          
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col xs12 md6">
                        <p class="ta-j"><img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" src="unit_3/module_10/assets/images/self_2_1.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                          For example, the report shares community
                          members’ stories of jobs and homes lost
                          and of struggling to make ends meet. These
                          challenges are no different for artists. A
                          distressing thread of testimony runs through
                          our research: general economic issues have
                          created displacement, unemployment, and
                          desperation for artists who place their gifts
                          at the service of democracy, renewal, and
                          equity through community-based work such
                          as participatory murals, social-issue theater,
                          hip-hop education, and many other forms.<br/><br/>
                          We work with people across the country
                          to envision how their communities can be
                          transformed by the power of art and culture
                          and to share what they see. We invite them to dream in public of a future in which full
                          cultural citizenship is a reality. “Cultural citizenship” describes circumstances in which
                          everyone feels welcome in their own communities; everyone appreciates that all of us
                          weave the social fabric binding us as a people; and full inclusion is embodied in every
                          aspect of our communities and institutions.<br/><br/>
                          We host art-infused public dialogues on communities’ futures (“Imaginings”) and
                          USDAC National Actions. For example, last January’s People’s State of the Union
                          —it will be repeated again in 2016—invited people everywhere to contribute firstperson
                          stories revealing the state or our union. The recent #DareToImagine set up
                          “Imagination Stations” across the U.S., where “Emissaries from the Future invited
                          people to use arts-based exercises to share futures they want to inhabit. With advice
                          from our National Cabinet, these visions become exciting, accessible proposals for
                          new policies and initiatives.

                          Envisioning a new economy, it’s essential
                          to remember that everything created must
                          first be imagined. The gifts that artists learn
                          and teach—innovation, social imagination,
                          resilience, resourcefulness, connectivity—are
                          just what our society needs to bring about the
                          shift to a people-powered economy.
