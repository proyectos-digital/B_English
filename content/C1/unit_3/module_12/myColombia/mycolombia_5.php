In this framework, links have been established between paramilitary leaders and politicians, including members of Congress.”<br/><img class="u-responsive-img cont-image" src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/col_5_1.png" alt=""/></span><span>The UN official explained to the committee that 93 Colombian

                  <input class="c-input js-escribir" type="text" placeholder="Text here..."/> officials implicated in this scandal, known as “parapolitics,” Albuquerque e Silva added that the investigations “have been impeded” by the extradition of paramilitary and criminal leaders to the United States.<br/></span><span>According to Albuquerque e Silva, the extradition of these leaders have prevented the Colombian justice system from hearing testimonies on the paramilitaries’ “relationships with Colombian politicians, primarily congressmen and officials.”<br/></span><span>Earlier in May, it was reported that despite guarantees by the Colombian government, only six of the fourteen former top AUC paramilitary leaders who were extradited to the United States two years ago have been able to offer their testimony in Colombia’s Justice and Peace process, which offered illegal armed groups that demobilized shorter sentences for their cooperation in the justice system.<br/></span><span>Albuquerque e Silva also reiterated previous statements, calling the Justice and Peace process “very slow,” and noted that “not issued a single [judicial] sentence” has been delivered against the thousands of paramilitaries who demobilized under the program.</span></p>
