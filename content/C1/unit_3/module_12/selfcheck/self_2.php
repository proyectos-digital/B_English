                        <p class="ta-j"><strong>1</strong> I just got back from a trip to Hungary last week, and I had this revelation: Things aren’t
                          all that bad in the United States right now.<br/>
                          The current cynical take is that we’re still OK because the Trump administration’s
                          <strong>malevolence</strong> has been counterbalanced by its incompetence. That’s hardly a
                          consolation, much less a <strong>fail-safe</strong> plan for the next three and a half years.<br/>
                          Shortly after the 2016 election, Yale University historian Timothy Snyder identified 20
                          lessons from the 20th century about how authoritarianism takes root in democratic
                          societies, but even he agrees that it’s a little premature to be disillusioned. So far, we still
                          are fighting back. Even though we should never say never when it comes to the Trump
                          state, we could keep a few things in context.<br/>
                          Hungary, for instance.<br/><br/>
                          <strong>2</strong> I went to Hungary for personal reasons:<br/>
                          I used to live there, and my <strong>in-laws</strong> still do, and
                          <img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/self_2_1.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                          I visit every few years. The country’s trajectory
                          since 2010 is a cautionary tale for us.<br/>
                          From the country’s independence in 1920
                          through 1989, Hungary was governed by
                          nationalist or communist autocrats. Its
                          experience with democracy only functionally
                          began in 1989 when the Iron Curtain fell and the
                          newly freed nation amended its constitution to
                          transform into a modern democratic republic.
                          
                          
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col xs12 md6">
                        <p class="ta-j"><img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/self_2_2.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                          <strong>3</strong> But since 2010, the government of Prime
                          Minister Viktor Orbán has steadily transformed
                          Hungary from a once-promising emergent
                          democracy into a throwback to its authoritarian
                          and nationalist past. There are a lot of little
                          reasons for Hungary’s backsliding, but the
                          main one is Orbán himself, a man, like Trump,
                          who knows how to seize a political moment.<br/>
                          In the 1980s, this dynamic young lawyer
                          became one of the first public figures to
                          call for the end of the Soviet occupation,
                          and his party, Fidesz, was an advocate
                          of Western values in opposition to the
                          socialist government. After Fidesz obtained
                          a supermajority of Parliament seats in
                          2010, Orbán rapidly consolidated power, forcing critics out of the party and passing
                          constitutional amendments that tightened government control of broadcast and print
                          media and reduced the independence of the judiciary.<br/>
                          Orbán’s nationalism found another target in the waves of refugees from Syria and
                          other war-torn regions that began pouring over the border from Serbia in 2015 until
                          the government fenced off the border. Orbán also has been trying to rid Hungary of
                          NGOs, particularly those that draw funding from Western sources.<br/><br/>
                          <strong>4</strong> His favorite boogeyman is Hungarian American financier George Soros, who opened
                          his Open Society Foundations’ Budapest office in 1984 to promote democratization
                          and civil society and established Central European University in the city to educate
                          a new generation of democratic leaders from the region. This year the government
                          launched a $21 million advertising campaign—with billboards along highways and
                          posters in train stations and other public places—which takes aim at Soros with thinly
                          disguised anti-Semitism.

                          <strong>5</strong> It’s a strategy that has benefitted Orbán: The
                          third-largest political party in Parliament is now
                          Jobbik, an extremist right-wing group that has
                          its own paramilitary group of supporters. Over
                          the years, Orbán has co-opted several Jobbik
                          positions to maintain his popularity, but the
                          only result has been to make Jobbik lurch even
                          further rightward. Street protests against the
                          government are common in Budapest these
                          days, but the rest of the country, especially the
                          rural areas, is more quiescent.<br/><br/>
                          The xenophobia, the bigotry, the rural people
                          versus city people—it’s all familiar. We have
                          a nationalist authoritarian in charge, and we
                          also have had frequent demonstrations across the country.
