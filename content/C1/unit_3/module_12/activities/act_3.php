                    <p class="ta-j">
                      In March, progressive activists in the United Kingdom had reasons to feel deeply
                      discouraged. Nine months earlier, a majority had voted for Brexit, setting in motion plans
                      to pull the U.K. out of the European Union. Then Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May
                      decided to call a “snap election” with the goal of consolidating Tory power in Parliament
                      in the face of weak opposition. The Labour Party, led by progressive Jeremy Corbyn, was
                      polling at a miserable 24 percent and facing the possibility of further marginalization.
                      But on June 8, Corbyn and the Labour Party experienced a stunning reversal of fortune,
                      almost winning the national election called in to vanquish them. And as of mid-July, Labour is
                      8 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.<br/>
                      One key force in this change was a grassroots
                      network called Momentum, formed in 2015 to
                      build participation and engagement in the Labour
                      Party. This election, Momentum mobilized 23,000
                      members and 150 local chapters through onthe-ground
                      campaigning and social media. Think

                      Our Revolution and MoveOn.org with a powerful
                      electoral field operation.<br/>
                      “The results were beautiful,” said Deborah
                      Waters, a Momentum co-founder and volunteer.
                      “I heard it described as ‘the bitterest of victories
                      for the Conservatives and the sweetest of
                      defeats for Labour.’ The winners didn’t really
                      win and the losers didn’t really lose.”

                      How did this reversal happen? And what can
                      those of us deep in this Trump presidency learn
                      from it? What follows are eight lessons from
                      Momentum and Labour’s remarkable campaign.<br/><br/>
                      <strong>1. Mobilize the base, both newcomers and long-time supporters</strong><br/>
                      What Momentum did best, according to
                      national organizer Emma Rees, “was [to]
                      energize and mobilize people.” Rees said that
                      at every training session they’ve had—33 so
                      far—half the people who attended have
                      been completely new to political organizing
                      and “had never knocked on a door.”<br/>
                      New recruits were attracted to Momentum
                      through creative social media <strong>outreach</strong>, campaigns featuring popular artists, and one-on-one
                      connections through personal networks.<br/>
                      Momentum also activated long-time Labour voters who hadn’t been <strong>enlisted</strong> to work
                      for the campaign in decades.<br/>
                      Whether new to the Labour Party or long-time supporters, Momentum recruits were
                      put to work for the campaign: Thousands of members knocked on doors, made phone
                      calls and performed other volunteer campaign tasks.<br/><br/>
                      <strong>2. Focus on reducing inequality</strong><br/>
                      With their slogan “For the Many, Not the Few,” Labour and Momentum put issues of
                      income, wealth, and social inequality at the center of the campaign. According to their
                      website, Momentum’s goals are to “redistribute wealth and power from the few to the
                      many, put people and planet before profit and narrow corporate interests, and build
                      a society free from all types of discrimination.”
                      
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="c-flickity--cell">
            <div class="row" style="height:680px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y:auto;">
              <div class="c-cardGreen">
                <div class="c-cardGreenContent u-textColor_1 ">
                  <div class="col xs12 md6">
                    <p class="ta-j">
                      Waters, a veteran Labour Party organizer, said this focus on inequality made their campaign
                      much more inclusive than in past elections, when her party focused primarily on turning
                      out Labour-identified voters. Focusing on inequality helped the campaign reach across
                      party lines, she said. “When it comes down to it, we all have the same worries, the same
                      fears for our families. Basically, it’s about reducing inequalities.”<br/><br/>
                      <strong>3. Defense is not enough: Put forward a bold vision</strong><br/>
                      When Theresa May called a snap election, some Labour leaders wanted to shift into
                      defensive mode. “The initial response of some sections of the Labour Party was to run a
                      ‘Stop the Tory landslide’ campaign,” said Rees. That kind of campaign would have been all
                      about damage mitigation, she said.<br/>
                      Instead, Momentum ran a campaign that called for transformative change in the lives
                      of ordinary people. Rees believes that vision motivated people to participate in the
                      campaign and, ultimately, to vote.<br/><br/>
                      <strong>4. Keep it local</strong><br/>
                      At the heart of Momentum are 150 local,
                      volunteer-run groups. As of June, there was
                      a small national team of six paid organizers
                      and another dozen full-time volunteers,
                      <img class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10  " src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/act_3_3.png" alt="" align="right"/>
                      supporting a field of thousands of volunteers
                      for local chapters.<br/>
                      To become an official local Momentum group,
                      there are some basic guidelines. Local groups
                      must have gender parity, a meeting space with
                      disabled access, a Facebook page, and a group
                      email address. But otherwise, local groups can
                      choose to self-organize in any way. The national
                      team provides support but also learns from local
                      chapters and shares ideas among the network.
                      
                      
                      
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col xs12 md6">
                    <p class="ta-j"><img class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10  " src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/act_3_4.png" alt="" align="left"/>
                      Local Momentum activists knocked on tens of
                      thousands of doors, set up information tables
                      at markets, and worked to have real, one-onone
                      connections with people.<br/><br/>
                      <strong>5. Get activists into swing districts</strong>
                      Momentum identified 66 swing districts where
                      Labour had in previous elections come within
                      7,000 votes of winning. Waters said that though
                      many thought this was a waste of resources,
                      Momentum was getting signals from their
                      local chapters that there was tremendous
                      grassroots energy for change.<br/>
                      To help organizers target swing districts,
                      Momentum created a website where
                      volunteers can locate nearby swing districts by entering their postal codes. The website
                      also matched people to carpool to nearby districts so volunteers could support local
                      chapters with more canvassers. In the end, Labour won all but four of the 66 swing
                      districts they targeted and picked up 32 seats.
