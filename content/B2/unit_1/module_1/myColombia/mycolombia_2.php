            Francis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devon, around 1540. He went to sea at an early age. In
            1567, he made one of the first English slaving <strong>voyages</strong> to America, bringing African <strong>slaves</strong> to
            work in the ‘New World’. All but two ships of the expedition were lost when they were attacked
            by a Spanish <strong>fleet </strong>. The Spanish became a lifelong enemy for Drake and they in turn considered
            him a pirate.<br/><br/>
            In 1596, after raiding and trading for slaves in Africa, Drake´s fleet roamed the settlements in
            the <strong>Caribbean Sea</strong> . These included Margarita Island and Borburata in <strong>Venezuela</strong> , and Riohacha
            and <strong>Santa Marta</strong> in Colombia. Cultivating <strong>pearls</strong> was an important activity in Riohacha at
            that time. In fact, Riohacha was famous for its pearls. This is why Drake was drawn there.<br/><br/>
            While in Riohacha, it´s said that Drake had stolen some <strong>canoes</strong> from the people. When he
            returned to Riohacha from a trip to <strong>Cabo de la Vela</strong> , he tried to sell the canoes back to the
            people of Riohacha, who refused to buy them because they considered them theirs in the first
            place. In <strong>anger</strong>, Drake <strong>burned down</strong> the city and continued to Santa Marta, which he also
            burned down because the people refused to pay <strong>ransom</strong> for their governor.<br/><br/>
            It´s also said that Drake´s stay in <strong>Riohacha</strong> was fatal for him. He apparently contracted
            dysentery there. Just before arriving at Portobelo in <strong>Panamá</strong>, Drake died of dysentery aboard
            his ship, the <strong>Defiance</strong>. He lies buried off Portobelo, in a lead <strong>coffin</strong>.
