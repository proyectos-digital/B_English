        <p class="ta-j">Hi! My name is Jenny. I am ten years old. I am excited because tomorrow my dad is going to take me to the zoo. This will be the second time we visit the zoo this month. I really enjoy it! By the time we arrive at the zoo, all attractions ill have been opened for a couple of hours, so we will be able to visit them all! We are going to see snakes! The last time we visited, I say a very tiny green snake. I want to see more snakes! We will also see the tigers. I am going to roar at the tigers! I am going to sing like the birds and I am going to flap my arms and fly with them too! I will ask my ad to take me to see the giraffes too. They have very long necks. I am going to pretend that my neck is very long just like a giraffe! I´m hoping my dad will let me buy something from the gift shop. I don’t know hat I am going to want but I can’t wait to see what there is! I love stuffed animals. I have a large collection at home. f I buy some new ones this time, I will have grown collection! We are going to have fun! I am so excited!</p>
