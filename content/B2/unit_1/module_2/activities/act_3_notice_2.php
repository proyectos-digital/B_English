        <p class="ta-j">During the next four billion years, the luminosity of the Sun will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in the solar radiation reaching the Earth. In about 600 million years, the level of CO2 will fall below the level needed to sustain photosynthesis of trees. The long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life, since plants are the basis of the food chain on Earth.</p>
        <p class="ta-j">In about 1.1 billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher than at present. This will cause the atmosphere to become a “moist greenhouse”, resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth’s surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect. By that point, most if not all the life on the surface will be extinct. </p>
