Today, we are going to review three aspects you need to take into consideration: Your skills and abilities, your location, and your financial situation. Letâ€™s start with the first one: The most important consideration is your abilities. For example, if you are good at Math, you can choose any Engineering, Physics, Accounting. If you have verbal linguistic abilities, you can choose Social Communications, Languages or Law. The second consideration is location. Where do you live? Are there universities available in your area? If you choose another city, how easy or difficult is this going to be for you? Finally, you have to consider your finances: The cost of university studies include tuition, materials, and money for basic needs. Sometimes this consideration affects the other two considerations. There are programs and universities that are very expensive. In the end, it has to be your decision.</p>
