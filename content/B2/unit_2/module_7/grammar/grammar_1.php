              <li>• In quoted or direct speech, someone’s exact words are repeated. Quotation marks enclose his or her words. Example: Andrés said “I want to live in Manizales.”</li>
              <li>• In reported speech, someone’s words are described using said. No quotation marks are used. Some changes are made: - If the original statement is in the present, the verb is changed to the past. Pronouns or possessive adjectives change person.</li>
              <li><strong><span class="u-textColor_5-dark">• Example:</span></strong> “I want to live in Manizales”. <br/> Andres said that he <strong>wanted</strong> to live in Manizales If the original statement is in the past, often the verb is not changed. Pronouns or possessive adjectives change person.</li>
              <li><strong><span class="u-textColor_5-dark">• Example:</span></strong> “I wanted to live in Manizales”. <br/> Andres said <strong>he wanted</strong> to live in Manizales. If the original statement is in the present perfect, the verb changes to the past perfect. Pronouns or possessive adjectives change person</li>
              <li><strong><span class="u-textColor_5-dark">• Example:</span></strong> “I have studied in Pereira for three years.” <br/> Andres said that he <strong>had studied</strong> in Pereira for three years. <strong>Commands</strong> are formed using the <strong>to-infinitive</strong> in statements and <strong>not + to-infinitive</strong> in negative statements. If we report somebody’s <strong>commands</strong>, we use the verb <strong>told</strong>. If it’s a <strong>request</strong>, the word used in the main clause is usually <strong>asked</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong><span class="u-textColor_5-dark">• Example:</span></strong> Please, be quiet. <br/> Andres asked me to be quiet. <br/> When we report yes/no questions we use ‘if’ or ‘whether’. The tense of the verb changes as it does in reported speech but we don’t use auxiliary verbs. The word order is the same as in an affirmative sentence.</li>
              <li><strong><span class="u-textColor_5-dark">• Example:</span></strong> “Are you coming to the meeting?” <br/> Andres asked me if I was coming to the meeting. <br/> When there is a <strong>question word</strong> (what, where, why, who, when, how) we use that question word in the reported question but there is no auxiliary verb and the word order is like an affirmative sentence.</li>
              <li><strong><span class="u-textColor_5-dark">• Example:</span></strong> “Where do you live?” Andres asked <strong>me where I lived</strong>.</li>
