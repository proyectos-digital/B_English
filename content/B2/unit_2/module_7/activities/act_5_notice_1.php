        <p>Jesus and Adriana are the funniest couple I have ever met. They <span class="u-textColor_3">got married</span> 15 years ago. Jesus is very organized but he spends a lot of money. Last year, he almost <span class="u-textColor_3">went bankrupt</span>. He was so stressed that he began <span class="u-textColor_3">to go bald</span>. After the crisis, <span class="u-textColor_3">he got ready</span> to start a new life and be more careful with his expenses. Adriana, on the other hand, has a terrible sense of orientation. <span class="u-textColor_3">She gets lost</span> all the time! Last time, she was downtown Palmira, and she was looking for some fruit, because she <span class="u-textColor_3">is going on a diet</span>. She <span class="u-textColor_3">got totally lost</span>, and Jesus had to go and pick her up. The good thing is that they are a very happy couple!</p>
