                 Jay White has always wanted to be a writer. He wrote his first story when he was five and sent it into a competition - it won! After he had won the competition he started writing every day. His first book was published in 1979 when he was only 12. "I'd been writing for several years but I was still really excited when my first book came out."</p>
              <p>Since then he has written more than thirty books. Last year he entered another competition. He chose to enter a book he had written when he was only nine. Why did he choose this particular book? "I'd been thinking about this story for a long time. Although I was only nine when I wrote it, I thought it was one of the best stories I have ever created.‚Äù</p>
