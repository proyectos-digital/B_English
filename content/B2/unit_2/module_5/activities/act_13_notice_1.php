               We use the past perfect <strong>(had left)</strong> because the action happened before another action in the past (Mariana rang the doorbell.)</p>
            <p>When we talk about something that happened before in the past we sometimes want to refer back to something that happened before that time. We can use the past perfect tense <strong>(had + past participle) </strong>to do this.</p>
            <p>The past perfect can also be used in the continuous form:<strong> had + been + ing.</strong></p>
