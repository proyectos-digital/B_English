        <p class="ta-r">The <strong>boldfaced words are phrasal verbs</strong>. These are formed with a verb and a particle and/or a preposition.  These verbs cannot be understood based upon the meanings of the individual parts in isolation, but rather they have to be taken as a whole. Phrasal verbs that include a preposition are known as  <strong>prepositional verbs</strong> and phrasal verbs that include a particle are also known as  <strong>particle verbs</strong>.</p>
