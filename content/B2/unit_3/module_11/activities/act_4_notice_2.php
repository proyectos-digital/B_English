        <p class="ta-r">When you draw a conclusion about something, you can feel very sure about it or you can feel you don´t really know. We use different modal verbs to express different levels of certainty, probability or doubt. When you are very sure of your thinking, use <strong>must + verb </strong>to express your certainty. To express the negative of <strong>must, </strong>use <strong>can´t be. Mustn´t </strong>means prohibition. When you aren´t sure of something use <strong>may could, </strong>or <strong>might + verb.</strong></p>
        <p class="ta-r mb20 mt20"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p class="ta-r">. that <strong>can´t be </strong>right. There must be a mistake.</p>
        <p class="ta-r">. That letter <strong>may be </strong>for me. (I´m not sure.)</p>
        <p class="ta-r">. Those bills <strong>could be </strong>fake. (They look strange.)</p>
        <p class="ta-r">. I think it <strong>might rain</strong>tomorrow. (Maybe. The sky is getting darker.)</p>
