        <p>In 1528, an expedition left Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, to explore Florida. From the beginning, the expedition was unlucky. First, the expedition encountered hurricanes near Cuba, losing men and ships. And then, the captain of the expedition made a big mistake: he decided to divide the men into two groups. One small group stayed on the ships and sailed along the coast of Florida. And the other group, which was much bigger, left the ships at Tampa Bay and stayed on the land. The two groups never met again. The ships sailed away without many of the men. The men that were left made rafts and sailed until they reached Galveston Island in Texas. From 80 men who sailed west, only 15 survived. The survivors continued to travel across Texas and met different American Indian groups, who sometimes helped them. </p>
        <p>After 8 years of arriving in Florida, only 4 survivors made it to what is now Culiacan, in Sinaloa, Mexico.</p>
