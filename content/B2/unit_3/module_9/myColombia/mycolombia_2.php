              <p class="ta-j">Countries that are seriously looking for high-performance athletes usually opt to train them in countries with higher altitudes, mountains and distinctive weather. Tunja is becoming a world training center for high performance athletes, due to its strategic location. Tunja is also known for being a training center for extreme sports, such as rappeling, canoeing, climbing, mountain-biking, camping, and skating, amongst others. In 2013, the first skateboarding festival was held in Tunja. The festival was very successful and it now includes other sports, such as rollerblading.</p>
              <p class="ta-j">But extreme sports in Tunja are not only practiced by professional athletes or by the local people. Extreme sports have become an additional touristic option for national and international visitors, who can visit Tunja for a day of extreme sports adventures. Tourists can find one-day plans that include practicing an extreme sport like trekking, rappeling or even fishing. </p>
