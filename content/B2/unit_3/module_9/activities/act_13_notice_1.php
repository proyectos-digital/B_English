            A <strong>non-defining relative clause </strong>gives us <strong>extra information</strong> about something. </p>
        <p>We don't need this information to understand the sentence. In other words, we can<strong> omit </strong>this information and the sentence is not affected. </p>
        <p>We don't use "that" in non-defining relative clauses, so we need to use <strong>"which"</strong> if the pronoun refers to a thing, and<strong>"who"</strong> if it refers to a person. </p>
        <p>We can't drop the relative pronoun in this kind of clause, even if the relative pronoun is the subject of the clause.</p>
