             The additional information for a noun, called defining relative clauses, can be simplified, or reduced, in several ways:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="c-listDefault">
          <li>
             If the <strong>relative pronoun </strong> is the <strong>object of the verb</strong> then it can be <strong>omitted.</strong> In the example,<strong>"dress"</strong> is the object of the verb (buy). "I" is the subject. When the relative pronoun is the object, it can be omitted.</li>
          <li>If the relative <strong>pronoun</strong> is the <strong>subject of the verb</strong> then it <strong>cannot be omitted.</strong></li>
          <li>
             If the relative clause contains the verb "be" + any of the following then it can be reduced:</li>
          <li>
             (a) be + an adjective phrase. Note that other verbs are possible here as well as "be", such as "seem", "look" and "appear"</li>
          <li>(b) be + a prepositional phrase</li>
          <li>(c) be + a past participle</li>
          <li>(d) be + a present participle</li>
        </ul>
