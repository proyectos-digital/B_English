               A defining relative clause gives essential information about the noun or noun phrase it modifies. </p>
            <p><strong>Example: </strong>The man <strong>who is wearing the hat </strong>is my teacher. </p>
            <p>The purpose of a defining relative clause is to clearly define who or what we are talking about. Without this information, it would be difficult to know who or what is meant. In the example, it is the man who is wearing a hat. </p>
            <p>Not any other man.</p>

            <p><strong>Relative pronouns:</strong> The following relative pronouns are used in defining relative clauses:</p>
