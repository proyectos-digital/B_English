                            h5.ta-c.u-textWhite New South Wales to introduce ‘parenting contracts’
                            p.ta-c Wikinews.org, Monday, February 6, 2006
                            p.ta-j.
                                #[strong 1] New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma announced Sunday that his government
                                would be introducing “parenting contracts” for parents of children who are at #[strong risk]
                                of neglect. The contracts are the next element of the government’s “respect and
                                responsibility” reforms announced last month.
                                Premier Iemma believes that the contracts will help to reduce #[strong juvenile crime] by
                                forcing parents to take responsibility for their children’s actions.
                            p.ta-j.
                                #[strong 2] Parents would be forced to sign the contracts by the children’s court. They could
                                require parents to attend #[strong parenting] classes, undergo counselling, stop drug use or
                                stop consuming excessive amounts of alcohol depending on the situation. The NSW
                                Department of Community Services would be allowed to apply to the court for the
                                contracts to be drawn up.
                            p.ta-j.

                                If parents failed to #[strong comply] with the contracts
                                their children would be removed by authorities.
                                The Department of Community Services would
                                be able to apply to the court for contracts to
                                be drawn up.#[br]
                                The plan follows the murder of a taxi driver
                                in Sydney by two 14-year-old girls last week.
                                Following the arrest of the girls, Mr. Iemma said
                                he was concerned about the whereabouts of the
                                girl’s parents. Mr. Iemma denies that the contracts
                                are a #[strong knee-jerk] reaction to that incident.#[br]#[br]
                                #[strong 3] Speaking of the plan Mr. Iemma said, “We know the majority of people naturally take
                        .col.xs12.md6
                            p.ta-j.
                                their responsibilities as parents very seriously.” #[br]
                                “However, those children who are failed in this regard by their parents are at risk of
                                becoming adolescents and adults without respect.” #[br]
                                NSW Community Services minister, Reba Meagher referred to studies showing that
                                out of 1,000 neglected children, 256 came into contact with the juvenile justice system.
                                “There is plenty of evidence to show that children who are failed by their parents are
                                more likely not to complete their schooling, to become involved in crime and to abuse
                                their own children.” said Ms. Meagher.#[br]
                                A similar proposal has been made in South Australia by the opposition. The Liberals
                                have promised a similar system of contracts in South Australia if they are elected.  #[br]#[br]

                                #[strong 4] Child welfare advocates claim that it is not clear whether or not the plan is the best
                                solution to the problem.
                                Jane Woodruff from the Association of Child Welfare Agencies said “Do we know that this
                                is the right strategy and if we do, where’s that evidence, where’s that research, where’s
                                that practice experience so we don’t make mistakes in such an important area?”.
                                “If parents are going to be required to attend a certain range of services, who’s actually
                                going to provide those services?” she said.
                                Tasmania’s Human Services minister, David Llewellyn said that he has not been able to
                                look at the proposal in detail, but felt that “on the surface it does not seem appropriate
                                legislation for Tasmania”.

                        The local government in Australia is introducing a new law, calling for parents to sign
                        parenting contracts. This applies to parents who children are at #[input(type="text" class="c-input js-escribir")] of committing
                        #[input(type="text" class="c-input js-escribir")] . Parent must #[input(type="text" class="c-input js-escribir")] with the contracts and #[input(type="text" class="c-input js-escribir")]
                        counselling where necessary. The premier says this new law is based on facts and is not just a
                        #[input(type="text" class="c-input js-escribir")] reaction.
