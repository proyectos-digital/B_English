                                        h5.ta-c Alberto Salazar Disputes Allegations — Some of Which Were Never Made
                                        h6.ta-c In a lengthy response to stories by ProPublica and the BBC, Salazar addresses the allegations of former athletes and staff that he broke drug rules.
                                        p.ta-c by David Epstein #[br] ProPublica, June 24, 2015, 11:03 p.ta-j.m.
                                        p.ta-j.
                                            #[strong 1]. Three weeks after ProPublica and the BBC reported allegations that Alberto Salazar,
                                            the iconic coach of the Nike Oregon Project, had experimented with testosterone and
                                            broken drug rules, Salazar posted a detailed, two-part response on the group’s website.
                                            Salazar disputed several allegations that were not made in the stories, or inaccurately
                                            described allegations that were. He also confirmed others, admitting, for example, he
                                            tested testosterone gel on both of his sons. Salazar said the claims in the ProPublica
                                            and BBC stories are based on lies by disgruntled former athletes and employees or
                                            misunderstandings of his recommendations or conduct. “I will never permit doping.
                                            Oregon Project athletes must fully comply with the WADA Code and IAAF Rules,” Salazar
                                            said in the lengthy post.
                                        p.ta-j.
                                            #[strong 2]. The three-time winner of the New York City Marathon said he had pushed himself so
                                            hard as an athlete that “I still suffer today the negative physical effects of my excessive
                                            training … but will not hurt my athletes like I hurt myself.” His athletes, he said, have
                                            appropriate documentation for any medications, and he has never helped an athlete
                                            gain a medical exemption or prescription they didn’t need. Salazar reserved particular
                                            ire for Steve Magness, a former Oregon Project assistant coach and current head crosscountry
                                            coach at the University of Houston, who made several of the most contentious
                                            allegations. Magness told ProPublica and the BBC that he left the Oregon Project in
                                            2012 by mutual agreement with Salazar after he became disillusioned with the coach’s
                                            approach to medicine.

                                            #[img(src="unit_1/module_2/assets/images/act_3_1.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 " align="left")]
                                            #[strong 3].  In his response, Salazar said “Magness did not leave the Oregon Project. The Oregon Project terminated his contract in 2012.” Prior to the publication of the initial stories, Magness provided ProPublica and the BBC with a “Mutual Termination of Contract” letter from Nike. The letter, dated June 27, 2012, starts: “Dear Steve, as discussed, both you and NIKE have decided to terminate your NIKE contract … As such, this letter shall acknowledge the mutual decision to terminate the contract, effective immediately.” The short letter ends with: “We would like to thank you for your association with NIKE. Should an opportunity present itself to work together again in the future, NIKE would welcome consideration of such an opportunity.” Emails from Salazar, provided by Magness, express “complete confidence” in him just one month earlier. Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency is investigating Salazar and that “more than a dozen witnesses have been interviewed and USADA is actively pursuing documents and other evidence from Salazar.” Salazar was provided with an extensive list of questions a month prior to the initial ProPublica and BBC stories. He only answered a select group of them.
                                        p.ta-j.
                                            #[strong 4]. Salazar began today’s rebuttal by addressing an allegation about Salazar’s star athlete,
                                            Galen Rupp, that neither ProPublica nor the BBC made: “The claims that Galen has been
                                            on prednisone continuously since he was 15 are absolutely false.”
                                            ProPublica and the BBC published a document showing that Rupp, who won the silver
                                            medal in the 2012 Olympics, had apparently taken prednisone during one-time period
                                            when he was 16. The story did not report allegations of continuous use nor cite the age 15.

                                            Salazar also said the article falsely reported that Rupp had received therapeutic use exemptions [TUE] by manipulating the TUE system and that he had received “numerous TUEs for multiple different treatments.” TUEs are exemptions that are granted to allow athletes to use otherwise restricted drugs or treatments. No such assertions were made in the story. #[br] ProPublica and the BBC gave no accounting of TUEs given to Rupp in an elite running career that spans more than a decade. Salazar stressed that Rupp “has only received two TUEs in his running career since 2010.” Salazar also noted that TUEs “are a rare occurrence in the Oregon Project.” No allegation about the prevalence of TUEs among Oregon Project athletes was made.
                                        p.ta-j.
                                            #[strong 5]. One of the most controversial elements of the ProPublica and BBC stories was an allegation
                                            that Rupp, Salazar’s longtime star, may have used testosterone while still in high school.
                                            Magness provided a photograph of a Nike Lab document that included a 2002 notation by
                                            a scientist that said Rupp was “presently on prednisone and testosterone medication.”
                                            Prior to the initial stories, Salazar told ProPublica and the BBC that the notation was a mistake,
                                            and that Rupp was actually taking a legal dietary supplement meant to boost testosterone
                                            called Testoboost. In his current response, Salazar says that Rupp “does not recall exactly
                                            which supplement he took in 2002. It could have been Testoboost, Alpha Male, Tribex, or
                                            ZMA.” All are supplements meant to naturally boost testosterone.
                                            Magness told ProPublica and the BBC that when he asked Salazar at the time to explain
                                            the document, Salazar called Loren Myhre, the scientist who made the notation, “crazy” and
                                            said he would get it clarified. Magness said he never did. Myhre died in 2012 from ALS.

                                        p.
                                            #[strong 6]. In his response, Salazar questioned why Magness didn’t ask Myhre for an explanation
                                            at the time. Magness told ProPublica Wednesday that he didn’t know Myhre and that it
                                            was unfair to imply that it was his responsibility to investigate. Magness said there had
                                            been “no mention of the word ‘Testoboost.’” #[br]#[br]
                                            “I came to my superior, Salazar, and asked for answers,” Magness said. “It would have
                                            been a simple clarification to make at the time by Salazar to contact Myhre, someone
                                            who he had worked with for at least a decade, to clear up the confusion. Salazar admits
                                            that he did not make this simple request, and instead blames it on me for not searching
                                            out Myhre.”#[br]#[br]
                                            ProPublica contacted Mauro DiPasquale, the owner of Testoboost, who said that
                                            Salazar had recently contacted him in the hope that he would confirm that Rupp was
                                            taking Testoboost. DiPasquale told ProPublica he had no records regarding Salazar and
                                            Testoboost prior to 2004, and had no way of knowing whether Rupp was taking it in
                                            2002. A number of Oregon Project athletes have told ProPublica they took Testoboost
                                            at various times. Adam Goucher says that he took Testoboost, but does not believe any
                                            of his lab documents indicated that he was taking testosterone medication. Salazar’s
                                            current response says that Rupp cannot remember what he told Myhre. “[Rupp]
                                            believes that he referred to his supplements as his testosterone supplements, stuff,
