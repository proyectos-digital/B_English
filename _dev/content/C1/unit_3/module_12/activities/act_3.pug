                                    h6.ta-c: i 5 lessons U.S. progressives can learn from Jeremy Corbyn’s remarkable campaign.

                                        In March, progressive activists in the United Kingdom had reasons to feel deeply
                                        discouraged. Nine months earlier, a majority had voted for Brexit, setting in motion plans
                                        to pull the U.K. out of the European Union. Then Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May
                                        decided to call a “snap election” with the goal of consolidating Tory power in Parliament
                                        in the face of weak opposition. The Labour Party, led by progressive Jeremy Corbyn, was
                                        polling at a miserable 24 percent and facing the possibility of further marginalization.
                                        But on June 8, Corbyn and the Labour Party experienced a stunning reversal of fortune,
                                        almost winning the national election called in to vanquish them. And as of mid-July, Labour is
                                        8 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.#[br]
                                        One key force in this change was a grassroots
                                        network called Momentum, formed in 2015 to
                                        build participation and engagement in the Labour
                                        Party. This election, Momentum mobilized 23,000
                                        members and 150 local chapters through onthe-ground
                                        campaigning and social media. Think

                                        “I heard it described as ‘the bitterest of victories
                                        for the Conservatives and the sweetest of
                                        defeats for Labour.’ The winners didn’t really
                                        win and the losers didn’t really lose.”

                                        Momentum and Labour’s remarkable campaign.#[br]#[br]
                                        #[strong 1. Mobilize the base, both newcomers and long-time supporters]#[br]
                                        What Momentum did best, according to
                                        national organizer Emma Rees, “was [to]
                                        energize and mobilize people.” Rees said that
                                        at every training session they’ve had—33 so
                                        far—half the people who attended have
                                        been completely new to political organizing
                                        and “had never knocked on a door.”#[br]
                                        New recruits were attracted to Momentum
                                        through creative social media #[strong outreach], campaigns featuring popular artists, and one-on-one
                                        connections through personal networks.#[br]
                                        Momentum also activated long-time Labour voters who hadn’t been #[strong enlisted] to work
                                        for the campaign in decades.#[br]
                                        Whether new to the Labour Party or long-time supporters, Momentum recruits were
                                        put to work for the campaign: Thousands of members knocked on doors, made phone
                                        calls and performed other volunteer campaign tasks.#[br]#[br]
                                        #[strong 2. Focus on reducing inequality]#[br]
                                        With their slogan “For the Many, Not the Few,” Labour and Momentum put issues of
                                        income, wealth, and social inequality at the center of the campaign. According to their
                                        website, Momentum’s goals are to “redistribute wealth and power from the few to the
                                        many, put people and planet before profit and narrow corporate interests, and build
                                        a society free from all types of discrimination.”

                                    p.ta-j.
                                        Waters, a veteran Labour Party organizer, said this focus on inequality made their campaign
                                        much more inclusive than in past elections, when her party focused primarily on turning
                                        out Labour-identified voters. Focusing on inequality helped the campaign reach across
                                        party lines, she said. “When it comes down to it, we all have the same worries, the same
                                        fears for our families. Basically, it’s about reducing inequalities.”#[br]#[br]
                                        #[strong 3. Defense is not enough: Put forward a bold vision]#[br]
                                        When Theresa May called a snap election, some Labour leaders wanted to shift into
                                        defensive mode. “The initial response of some sections of the Labour Party was to run a
                                        ‘Stop the Tory landslide’ campaign,” said Rees. That kind of campaign would have been all
                                        about damage mitigation, she said.#[br]
                                        Instead, Momentum ran a campaign that called for transformative change in the lives
                                        of ordinary people. Rees believes that vision motivated people to participate in the
                                        campaign and, ultimately, to vote.#[br]#[br]
                                        #[strong 4. Keep it local]#[br]
                                        At the heart of Momentum are 150 local,
                                        volunteer-run groups. As of June, there was
                                        a small national team of six paid organizers
                                        and another dozen full-time volunteers,
                                        #[img(src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/act_3_3.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10  " align="right")]
                                        supporting a field of thousands of volunteers
                                        for local chapters.#[br]
                                        To become an official local Momentum group,
                                        there are some basic guidelines. Local groups
                                        must have gender parity, a meeting space with
                                        disabled access, a Facebook page, and a group
                                        email address. But otherwise, local groups can
                                        choose to self-organize in any way. The national
                                        team provides support but also learns from local
                                        chapters and shares ideas among the network.

                                        Local Momentum activists knocked on tens of
                                        thousands of doors, set up information tables
                                        at markets, and worked to have real, one-onone
                                        connections with people.#[br]#[br]
                                        #[strong 5. Get activists into swing districts]
                                        Momentum identified 66 swing districts where
                                        Labour had in previous elections come within
                                        7,000 votes of winning. Waters said that though
                                        many thought this was a waste of resources,
                                        Momentum was getting signals from their
                                        local chapters that there was tremendous
                                        grassroots energy for change.#[br]
                                        To help organizers target swing districts,
                                        Momentum created a website where
                                        volunteers can locate nearby swing districts by entering their postal codes. The website
                                        also matched people to carpool to nearby districts so volunteers could support local
                                        chapters with more canvassers. In the end, Labour won all but four of the 66 swing
                                        districts they targeted and picked up 32 seats.
