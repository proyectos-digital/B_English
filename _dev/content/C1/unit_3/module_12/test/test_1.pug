											h5.ta-c The senate just voted to keep big money in politics. Three reasons to celebrate anyway
											p.ta-c: i The fact that the issue reached the Senate floor is a huge victory for the American people, who overwhelmingly say they want something done about corporate influence in elections.
											p.ta-c Fran Korten posted Sep 11, 2014

												It was no surprise that the Senate’s proposed “Democracy for All” amendment to the
												constitution did not pass on Thursday. It takes 67 votes to pass an amendment in the
												Senate. So Thursday’s vote of 54 in favor and 42 against spelled defeat. But the vote
												represents a giant leap on the road to overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizens United
												decision, which opened the floodgates to money in elections. Here are three reasons
												for advocates to celebrate.#[br]#[br]
												#[strong 1. The vote demonstrates the power of grassroots activism].#[br]
												The Senate’s 54 to 42 on the “Democracy for
												All” amendment was widely attributed to the
												activism in towns, cities, and states across
												the country. Since January 21, 2010, when
												#[img(src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/test_1_1.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10" align="left")]
												the Supreme Court handed down its decision
												in Citizens United, 16 states and more than
												550 towns and cities have passed resolutions
												recommending a constitutional amendment.
												Advocates are undaunted by the Senate’s
												failure to pass the amendment. John Bonifaz,
												president of the nonprofit Free Speech for
												People, noted, “It’s just a matter of time. We
												will get the 28th Amendment.”

												#[img(src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/test_1_2.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 ml10 mt10" align="right")]
												#[strong 2. It puts pressure on politicians across party lines].#[br]#[br]
												At the national level, regulating money in
												politics is a highly partisan issue. Not a
												single Republican voted for the proposed
												amendment, introduced by Democrat
												Tom Udall of New Mexico. But among the
												public, that partisan division disappears.
												The public advocacy group Public Citizen
												recently released a poll conducted by leading
												Democratic and Republican pollsters.
												The numbers showed that Republicans,
												Democrats, and Independents all share
												disgust at the outsized influence of moneyed
												interests in our politics. Of the sample of
												800 “likely voters,” 61 percent opposed the
												Citizens United Decision, including 58 percent of Republicans. A whopping 78 percent
												(including 71 percent of Republicans) said reducing the influence of money in politics
												and elections was important. In response to arguments that restricting money in
												politics and elections is an assault on free speech, just 25 percent (including 38 percent
												of Republicans) agreed. The Senate vote puts 100 senators on record. Those voting
												against the amendment will need to explain their actions to their constituents.#[br]#[br]
												#[strong 3. It provides language that empowers the states and defines corporations as artificial legal entities].
												The proposed amendment specifies that not only the Congress but also the states may
												regulate “the raising and spending money in politics.” If this version of the amendment
												were to become law, it would mean that states would be able to move ahead, regardless
												of stalemates at the national level. It seems likely that many states would do so. Already,
												16 of them have recommended a constitutional amendment to restrict money in politics.

													The amendment also defines the nature of a corporation. Currently, nowhere in the
													Constitution or in any of its 27 amendments does the word “corporation” appear. The
													Senate’s amendment would introduce the word for the first time and in doing so define the
													corporation as an artificial legal entity. The amendment states: Congress and the States
													… may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities
													created by law, including prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence
													elections. Most of us have never doubted that humans are different from corporations.
													But all the way up to the Supreme Court, some judges have treated corporations as though
													they have the same constitutional rights granted to natural persons. If this amendment
													eventually passes, the distinction between natural persons and corporations would be
													written into the highest law of the land.#[br]
													Not everyone feels the amendment goes far enough. While the Senate’s “Democracy for
													All” amendment is backed by many organizations working to get big money out of politics,
													the advocacy group Move to Amend wants wording that specifies that corporations do
													not have constitutionally protected rights. Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana,
													has introduced a “People’s Rights” amendment
													(SJR-18), to do just that. It is meant as a
													companion to the Udall amendment just voted
													#[img(src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/test_1_3.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10" align="left")]
													on, but so far it has not garnered the same
													level of support. In the House, a parallel pair
													of amendments have been introduced by Jim
													McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts.#[br]
													No one expects two-thirds of the House to
													pass an amendment in the short term. But the
													pressure is on. As The New York Times stated
													in an op-ed about the issue, a constitutional
													amendment “…is a last resort to fix a grave civic
													problem. But the backers of this amendment
													recognize that the nature of American
													democracy is at stake.”#[br]

												p.ta-j.
													#[img(src="unit_3/module_12/assets/images/test_1_4.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10" align="left")]
													The framers of the Constitution made sure
													it would not be easy to pass a constitutional
													amendment. They specified that two-thirds
													of the House and Senate must vote for one,
													which then must be ratified by three-fourths of
													the state legislatures. And we know moneyed
													interests do not want their power curtailed
													and will fight the amendment tooth and nail.
													So there is a long road ahead.#[br]
													The struggle will not be led by the Senate. It
													will be led by the people. I like to remember
													that the fight for women’s right to vote began
													at Seneca Falls in 1848. The 19th Amendment
													giving women the franchise passed in 1920. It
													took 72 long years. In an age of instant mass
													communications, this campaign is moving far faster than that one. But it’s helpful to keep
													in mind that we’re just over four years down the road. We’ve come a long way. Time to
													take a moment to celebrate.
