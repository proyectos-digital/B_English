										h5.ta-c Art: For the Common Delight
										h6.ta-c: i Art today gives voice to the silenced, illuminates complex political issues, and brings joy to the public square.

											While the last 10 years have seen the #[strong weakening] of funding to individual artists and
											the end of many alternative venues for showing art, a global art scene is thriving. The
											#[strong broadening] and democratization of mainstream art, largely driven by the Internet, has
											helped reshape the aesthetic landscape from a New York-centric, gallery-driven scene
											to a thriving online global arts community.#[br]
											In 1995, #[strong widespread] access to the Internet produced a #[strong dazzling] explosion of
											opportunities for artists to connect with #[strong practitioners] from all over the world.
											Suddenly, in a single afternoon, an artist could “visit” a Prague printshop, view the Cone
											sisters' collection of early Modernist works at
											the Baltimore Museum, chat with a collective
											of feminist artists in New Zealand, submit
											work to an abundance of shows worldwide—
											or show and sell from her own website.#[br]#[br]

											The Internet has created not just virtual art spaces but new opportunities for showing
											physical art in the real world, giving new scope to DIY (do it yourself) ingenuity. A traveling
											exhibit, for example, that would once have been organized by #[strong curators] might now be
											artist-created and controlled—and feature works from all over the world.#[br]#[br]
											One such show, organized online, opened in Milwaukee in 2001, featuring mixed
											media works ranging from Chicago artist Carlos Cortez' woodcut posters for Industrial
											Workers of the World (I.W.W.) to #[strong Beehive] Design Collective artists Kehban Grifter and
											Juan Manchu's images in collaboration with several Colombian communities. By August
											2005, the exhibit had been shown in 27 cities and traveled more than 25,000 miles,
											aided by a website, www.drawingresistance.org, that became a virtual gathering place.
											“Drawing Resistance” depended on publicity and #[strong fund]-raising from each local venue.

											The capacity to stay connected online has helped power a healthy diaspora of artists to
											places besides New York, just as the Internet emphasis on communication has encouraged
											artists toward collective art activities that make an end run around market influences.
											It has also encouraged new forms of arts education. The Beehive Collective (www.
											beehivecollective.org), an ongoing, decentralized collaboration of anonymous “bees,”
											has made it its mission “to #[strong cross-pollinate] the #[strong grassroots”] by producing images
											that anyone is free to take and use. Among other projects, the “hive” delivers some 200
											lectures per year on globalization and promotes collaborations between the visual and
											literary arts.#[br]
											Community arts programs—curricula for teaching a more socially engaged art—
											emerged at such campuses as the Institute for Social Ecology and Goddard College,
											both in Plainfield, Vermont. A group of 60 “eco artists” who gathered at the 1998 College
											Art Association meeting in L.A. formed an ongoing network of artists concerned with
											preserving and #[strong restoring] the natural world.#[br]
											One such project, completed in June 2005, is “Three Rivers Second Nature”—an
											analysis of three river systems and 53 streams
											of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania initiated
											by Carnegie Mellon University's Studio
											for Creative Inquiry. A team of artists and
											researchers, headed by Tim Collins and Reiko
											#[img(src="unit_3/module_10/assets/images/act_3_3.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10 " align="left")]
											Goto, synthesized information gathered from
											historians, landscape architects, geographic
											information systems specialists, botanists,
											engineers, and water-policy experts to map
											the region's natural history, analyze water
											use, and consider stream restoration. On
											completion of the project, the team presented
											their findings to the public.#[br]
											#[strong Meanwhile], the traditional #[strong notion] of public
											art—a discrete object made without much

											consideration for a particular place—has undergone a transformation that reflects
											artists' deepening understanding of what it means to work in community. Artists first
											began to take into account the history and ecology of a particular site in the early 1970s.
											A natural next step was to consult with community members, perhaps #[strong eliciting] their
											ideas and even some contributions. Over the last decade, a public art has emerged that
											seeks to place the creative process #[strong wholly] in the hands of the community, with the
											artist in the role of facilitator, helping to draw forth a community's stories. Community
											has been defined broadly to include such marginalized groups as #[strong inmates] and #[strong shelter]
											#[strong inhabitants].#[br]
											But of all recent developments, it may be the emergence of artist-activists in their 20s
											that is most exciting. A different #[strong breed] from past art school graduates competing to
											become “art stars,” these young people make art in service to social change. They do
											“reclamation art” projects at degraded sites. They help create dialogue among polarized
											groups. They work to foster a sense of community. They are the hopeful future of art.
