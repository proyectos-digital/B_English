											h5.ta-c Acts of collective imagination: notes from the chief policy wonk at America’s department of arts and culture
											p.ta-c Arlene Goldbard posted Nov 11, 2015
											p.ta-j.
												Imagine if U.S. policy looked like this: A universal, publicly funded Basic Income Grant
												(BIG) covered economic needs, benefiting every person equally; and Cultural Impact
												Studies (CIS), analogous to environmental impact studies, assessed the potential
												impacts of proposed development on our cultural fabric. This public policy would value
												the sense of belonging, sites of public memory, gathering places, and expressions of
												heritage cultures that would be destroyed when a longstanding neighborhood is razed
												to make way for a new freeway or sports stadium.#[br]#[br]
												These are just two of the cultural policy proposals featured in the U.S. Department of
												Arts and Culture’s recently published An Act of Collective Imagination: The USDAC’s First
												Two Years of Action Research. As “Chief Policy Wonk,” I coordinate the National Cabinet
												and authored the report. We like to say the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture is the
												nation’s first people-powered department. It’s not a government agency—it’s not even
												affiliated with government— but a national action network mobilizing artists, cultural
												workers, and other community members to use creativity for social justice. We’re trying
												to spark a creative, grassroots movement that engages millions of people in enacting a
												world rooted in empathy, equity, and social imagination. Using arts-based methods, we
												invite people to envision the future they want to inhabit, and create projects to realize
												their visions.#[br]#[br]
												An Act of Collective Imagination puts forward six cultural policy ideas grounded in
												grassroots visions, including BIG and CIS. Two key considerations shaped the report:
												linking local and national concerns and organizing; proposing policies that emerge from
												people’s lived knowledge rather than from distanced expertise; and promoting a broad
												public interest in culture, too often dismissed as a special-interest frill.

												For example, the report shares community
												members’ stories of jobs and homes lost
												and of struggling to make ends meet. These
												challenges are no different for artists. A
												distressing thread of testimony runs through
												our research: general economic issues have
												created displacement, unemployment, and
												desperation for artists who place their gifts
												at the service of democracy, renewal, and
												equity through community-based work such
												as participatory murals, social-issue theater,
												hip-hop education, and many other forms.#[br]#[br]
												We work with people across the country
												to envision how their communities can be
												transformed by the power of art and culture
												and to share what they see. We invite them to dream in public of a future in which full
												cultural citizenship is a reality. “Cultural citizenship” describes circumstances in which
												everyone feels welcome in their own communities; everyone appreciates that all of us
												weave the social fabric binding us as a people; and full inclusion is embodied in every
												aspect of our communities and institutions.#[br]#[br]
												We host art-infused public dialogues on communities’ futures (“Imaginings”) and
												USDAC National Actions. For example, last January’s People’s State of the Union
												—it will be repeated again in 2016—invited people everywhere to contribute firstperson
												stories revealing the state or our union. The recent #DareToImagine set up
												“Imagination Stations” across the U.S., where “Emissaries from the Future invited
												people to use arts-based exercises to share futures they want to inhabit. With advice
												from our National Cabinet, these visions become exciting, accessible proposals for
												new policies and initiatives.

												Envisioning a new economy, it’s essential
												to remember that everything created must
												first be imagined. The gifts that artists learn
												and teach—innovation, social imagination,
												resilience, resourcefulness, connectivity—are
												just what our society needs to bring about the
												shift to a people-powered economy.
