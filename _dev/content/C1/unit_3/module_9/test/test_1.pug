                                p.ta-c Sunday, February 3, 2008
                                p.ta-j.
                                    The first two days of New York Fashion Week have debuted fashions similar to past
                                    years. Since Friday’s opening of what is the world’s largest fashion show, many designers
                                    have unveiled their newest designs. These include turtleneck sweaters and miniskirts.
                                    However, the ubiquitous fashion staple seen on the runway has been incorporated in
                                    designs that are even shorter than in past years.#[br]
                                    Major labels like Nicole Miller, Lacoste, BCBG, and Baby Phat debuted their styles in the first
                                    two days of the week-long extravaganza, nominally the official unveiling of the Fall 2008
                                    styles and leading up to similar fashion shows in Los Angeles, London, Paris and Milan.
                                    If the first two days of Fashion Week are any indication, another year of miniskirts are in
                                    vogue, partnered with tights, which were widely expected to go out of fashion for 2008.
                                    Day one kicked off with a Red Dress Campaign fashion show, aimed at educating people
                                    on the dangers of heart disease. Among the celebrities to walk in red gowns for the Red
                                    Dress fashion show were Rita Moreno and Liza Minnelli.#[br]
                                    Talk of a budding recession in the United States has sparked fears in the couture world,
                                    in which a lackluster fashion season can make or break many designers, both up-and-comers
                                    and established names. New York designer Nanette Lepore has led the charge
                                    to save money by only debuting two different collections a year.#[br]
                                    New York Fashion Week runs until Friday. Designers yet to unveil their fall lines include
                                    Oscar de la Renta, Anna Sui, Bill Blass, Michael Kors, Vera Wang, and Diane von
