											h5.ta-c The Wall Street money machine Margin Call: A small movie unveils big truths about wall street
											p.ta-c by Jake Bernstein#[br]ProPublica, Nov. 23, 2011, 6 a.m
											p.ta-j.
												#[strong 1] J.C. Chandor has embraced Rahm Emanuel’s dictum “never let a serious crisis go to
												waste.” The 37-year-old writer and director used the financial crisis as a springboard
												to create the most insightful Wall Street movie ever filmed. Margin Call captures a day
												in the life of a Lehman Brothers-like bank as it scrambles to avoid falling into the first
												cracks of the financial crisis. Briskly paced and marvelously acted, the movie reveals
												how large financial institutions operate and the motivations of the people who work
												within them.#[br]#[br]
												#[strong 2] Margin Call should not be confused with journalism. It is not a precise overlay of
												the financial crisis. You’ll never hear the words collateralized debt obligations uttered
												in the movie. As the reporting I did with my colleague Jesse Eisinger showed, the Wall
												Street behavior that helped create the financial crisis was often much worse than what’s
												depicted in the movie. Chandor isn’t looking for villains or lengthy explanations. He’s
												mining deeper truths than the intricacies of credit default swaps. The societal costs
												of high finance, the power of self-rationalization, and the easy embrace of personal
												corruption is his terrain.#[br]
												As reporters covering the beat know, Wall Street is a reluctant participant in introspection.
												Journalists investigating the Street have to pierce a code of omertà, borne of the fear
												of lawsuits and federal investigations. No one wants to have the reputation of being a
												snitch in an industry where hiring and bonuses are based on relationships as much
												as quarterly results. The truth is even more tightly held when it hides the origins of
												financial disaster, but even in the best of times, these are not, by nature, navel gazers.
												Traders and market makers are like sharks, always wanting to move forward, onto the
												next deal. There is no percentage in looking back.

												#[strong 3] All you need to know about the moral
												universe Margin Call inhabits is on display in
												the opening scene of the movie. The downturn
												has begun. The firing squad -- represented
												by two women in identical business suits
												-- arrives on the trading floor trailed by
												underlings carrying cardboard boxes to cart
												away personal effects. When they come into
												view, a series of swift reactions plays across
												the face of Will Emerson, a senior trader acted
												brilliantly by Paul Bettany. First fear. Then
												dismay. And finally, relief and dismissal. After
												80 percent of the floor is axed, Emerson’s
												boss, Sam, a wan Kevin Spacey, gives a pep
												talk to the traders left standing. “They were
												good. You are better. Now they are gone.
												They are not to be thought of again.”#[br]
												Among the casualties is the risk manager for the trading group, Eric Dale, played by
												Stanley Tucci. On the way, out the door, Dale tells his young protege, Peter Sullivan,
												that he has been working on something important. As the elevator closes, he hands
												Sullivan a zip drive and says cryptically, “Be careful.”#[br]#[br]
												#[strong 4] Sullivan, played by Zachary Quinto, who also helped produce the movie, waits until
												the office clears for the night and then dives into the figures. To his horror, he discovers
												the bank is massively overleveraged. If trends continue, projected losses are much
												greater than the value of the firm. Upon learning how dire the situation has become,
												the CEO John Tuld, portrayed by a scene-chewing Jeremy Irons, says, “So what you are
												telling me is that the music is about to stop and we are going to be left holding the
												biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.”

												Sullivan is the questioning heart of Margin Call. He has a doctorate in engineering with
												a speciality in propulsion -- literally a rocket scientist. And like so many of the best and
												brightest of his generation, he turned to Wall Street, where Chandor clearly believes
												his gain is society’s loss. When one of his superiors asks Sullivan why he has forsaken
												engineering, he responds: “It’s all just numbers really, just changing what you are adding
												up, and to speak freely, the money here is considerably more attractive.”
												Sullivan operates in the constricted space of the Wall Street risk manager. Risk managers
												and accountants are among the few who actually know what the numbers mean. They
												see the whole picture. It’s a running joke through the movie that Sullivan’s bosses, right
												up to the CEO, don’t understand the financial wizardry behind the products they make
												and sell. When confronted with Sullivan’s analysis, Sam says, “Oh Jesus, you know I can’t
												read these things. Just speak to me in English.”#[br]#[br]
												#[strong 5] The risk manager is not in sales, which is the heart and soul of the institution. He
												or she only offers recommendations. Throughout Margin Call there are a number of
												#[img(src="unit_2/module_8/assets/images/self_2_2.png" alt="" class="u-responsive-img w40 mr10 mt10" align="left")]
												references to warnings unheeded. And indeed,
												in the real world, the success of investment

												banks at subverting their risk management
												rules correlated nicely with how badly they
												fared when the crisis hit. In the ultimate irony,
												when it’s time for someone to take the fall
												for the firm’s risk taking, it’s the head of risk
												management, played by Demi Moore who is
												pushed to the scaffold.#[br]#[br]
