                            p.ta-c John Cavanagh, Robin Broad posted May 09, 2011
                            p.ta-j.
                                #[strong 1] In the heart of Trinidad’s ancient forests, we discover a concept that extends
                                ecotourism in a direction that excites us. “We like to call it community tourism, by which
                                we mean the tourist actually lives in the community and interacts with the people and
                                their surrounding environment,” explains local resident Kelly Warren.
                                We are #[strong smack-dab] in the middle of the mountain range covering the
                                northern quarter of Trinidad, in the village of Brasso Seco, population 350. Kelly and
                                her husband Carl Fitzjames are our hosts. Carl is listed in The Rough Guide to Trinidad
                                and Tobago as the “best guide” to this area in northern Trinidad, a little-explored gem of
                                flora and fauna biodiversity.

                            p.ta-j.
                                #[strong 2] Brasso Seco is a perfect base for hiking into the forest, bathing in waterfalls, being
                                tutored in medicinal plants, and learning about local agriculture. For us, it is a base to
                                walk and talk and learn. One day we walk with Kelly, Carl, and their two young children
                                down an old #[strong muddy] road that once led to a cocoa plantation. At every turn is a different
                                bird (as a bird-bander, Carl knows them all)—probably to be expected since there are
                                430 species packed into this small country. Blue morpho butterflies flit in and out of the
                                sunlight that cuts through the forests. Carl tells us about a golden frog that does not live
                                anywhere else in the world.

                            p.ta-j.
                                #[strong 3]  But community tourism means more than just nature treks. Another day, Carl cuts
                                huge leaves from a local palm for us to use as umbrellas as we hike through the driving
                                rain to see his organic “garden.” Deep in the forest, they are growing everything from
                                the root crops that Trinis call “provisions” to fruit trees and giant leafy green vegetables.
                                Kelly and Carl combine many of these into a #[strong scrumptious] and nutritious stew they
                                call “jungle pot.” As Carl explains, his garden and its nutritious food are his “first line of
                                defense,” the very first thing that local families here traditionally worry about.

                                #[strong 4]  Carl, now 57 (but looking more like 45), was trained decades ago as a nuclear welder
                                in Canada: “In my 30s, I’m working all over North America as a nuclear welder and I
                                read a confidential Canadian government report on all the highly noxious metals that
                                I’m inhaling … and I realized this isn’t really what I wanted to do with my life. That’s
                                when I did what I call making the leap … returning to my roots.” He returned to this
                                mountain town of Brasso Seco. “Making the leap”—it is a phrase that Carl and Kelly
                                keep repeating.#[br]
                                Carl’s roots are a mélange typical of these islands. His great-grandfather was a
                                Venezuelan tightrope walker who came to Trinidad in the circus. He was smitten by
                                a woman in the audience, one of a small community of Amerindians that somehow
                                survived colonialism, and he settled with her in Brasso Seco. By Carl’s own reckoning,
                                his blood includes strains from Africa, Spain, Venezuela, and the Amerindians that
                                originally came to Trinidad from South America.

                            p.ta-j.
                                #[strong 5]  As Carl’s stories reveal, he learned much of what he knows from his grandfather.
                                Carl is passing on his knowledge, training younger people in the village to be nature
                                guides in the hope that a growing demand by researchers and tourists for guides in
                                this ecologically and socially rich location will be met by Brasso Seco’s own. He is a
                                pragmatist as well as a dreamer and believes it is very possible for the government to
                                value agriculture, and alternative tourism as much as natural gas and giant industrial
                                projects.
