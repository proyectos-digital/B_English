                                #[strong 1] Despite border walls and travel bans, the Middle East is still a region where the weary
                                traveler is welcomed and embraced.#[br]
                                For much of human history, kindness to foreigners has been a cherished trait. “The
                                stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall
                                love him as yourself,” commanded the Old Testament. In Homer’s epic, Odysseus
                                traveled at the mercy of strangers, seeking out shelter in unknown lands. All throughout
                                the ancient texts, divine beings masquerade as vagabonds, their disguises designed to
                                test the mercy of their hosts. Graciousness is summarily rewarded, while hostility or
                                indifference leads to carnage and despair. Hospitality narratives highlight the rules of
                                etiquette that once bound host to guest.

                                #[strong 2] The beginnings of Western civilization were
                                shaped by these same codes of conduct.
                                But now, at least throughout much of the
                                developed world, hospitality—that safe
                                harbor for weary travelers—is in danger of
                                disappearing.
                                One of the lingering cruelties of President
                                Trump’s proposed travel bans is that they
                                target some of the regions of the globe where
                                hospitality is still sacrosanct. In disdaining
                                places where culture is still defined by
                                generosity, the U.S. is not only imperiling
                                its public image, but upending the basic
                                humanity that once governed the world.

                                “The industrialized countries, obedient to a cold rationality, have had to unlearn hospitality,”
                                observes the Moroccan-French writer Tahar Ben Jelloun, chronicling the rise of bigotry
                                in France. “Time is precious and space limited,” he laments. “Doors are shut, and so are
                                hearts.” The ancient Greek concept of “xenia” originally signaled friendship between
                                strangers—usually from distant foreign lands. Today, it survives in the English-speaking
                                world as the prefix to xenophobia. But despite decades of geopolitical strain, hospitality
                                still remains a crowning feature of the contemporary Middle East.#[br]#[br]
                                #[strong 3] On a solo backpacking trip across North Africa and the Levant, I once disembarked,
                                hot and disheveled, from a bumpy shared taxi in Irbid, an industrial city in northern
                                Jordan not far from the Syrian border. Dust streaked my face; I was wracked with
                                thirst. Suddenly, I found myself greeted with an unexpected act of welcome: A stranger
                                appeared, handed me a chunk of juicy watermelon, then vanished back into the crowd.
                                “It’s something in our hearts. We can’t help it,” a Syrian grad student told me recently,
                                explaining Middle Eastern hospitality while swatting away mosquitos at a Delhi rooftop
                                party. It was in considering how frequently and blithely I had already tromped around
                                Muslim-majority countries that Trump’s proposed bans struck me not only as illegal,
                                but also as intolerably unfair. In the age of Trump, Brexit, and the resurgence of
                                nationalism around the world, pining for unified, pre-immigrant cultures has become
                                a common conservative refrain. But it is nationalism—not multiculturalism—that
                                remains the modern and alien invention. Long before walls, bans, and border control
                                regulated and restricted mobility, territories were still fuzzy, and diversity in languages,
                                religions, and ethnicities was the norm. The medieval world was, above all, overrun with
                                travelers: Merchants, pilgrims, bureaucrats, missionaries, and vagrants all crisscrossed
                                adjacent lands. Traveling was seen not only as a privilege, but also an inalienable right.
