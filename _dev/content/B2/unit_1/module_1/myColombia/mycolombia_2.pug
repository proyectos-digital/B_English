                        Francis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devon, around 1540. He went to sea at an early age. In
                        1567, he made one of the first English slaving #[strong voyages] to America, bringing African #[strong slaves] to
                        work in the ‘New World’. All but two ships of the expedition were lost when they were attacked
                        by a Spanish #[strong fleet ]. The Spanish became a lifelong enemy for Drake and they in turn considered
                        him a pirate.#[br]#[br]
                        In 1596, after raiding and trading for slaves in Africa, Drake´s fleet roamed the settlements in
                        the #[strong Caribbean Sea] . These included Margarita Island and Borburata in #[strong Venezuela] , and Riohacha
                        and #[strong Santa Marta] in Colombia. Cultivating #[strong pearls] was an important activity in Riohacha at
                        that time. In fact, Riohacha was famous for its pearls. This is why Drake was drawn there.#[br]#[br]
                        While in Riohacha, it´s said that Drake had stolen some #[strong canoes] from the people. When he
                        returned to Riohacha from a trip to #[strong Cabo de la Vela] , he tried to sell the canoes back to the
                        people of Riohacha, who refused to buy them because they considered them theirs in the first
                        place. In #[strong anger], Drake #[strong burned down] the city and continued to Santa Marta, which he also
                        burned down because the people refused to pay #[strong ransom] for their governor.#[br]#[br]
                        It´s also said that Drake´s stay in #[strong Riohacha] was fatal for him. He apparently contracted
                        dysentery there. Just before arriving at Portobelo in #[strong Panamá], Drake died of dysentery aboard
                        his ship, the #[strong Defiance]. He lies buried off Portobelo, in a lead #[strong coffin].
