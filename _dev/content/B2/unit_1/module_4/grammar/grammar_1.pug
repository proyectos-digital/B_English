                        p In the passive voice, #[strong the object ] in an active sentence becomes #[strong the subject ] of the passive sentence.
                        p: strong The passive voice is used when:

                        p • We do not know who did the action:
                        p • The receiver of the action is more important.

                        p In the passive voice, the #[strong by + agent phrase ] is used when it is important to say who performed the action.
                        p
                            strong Example: 
                            | The National Symphonic Orchestra is directed by a Russian musician.

                            strong by + agent phrase 
                            | is omitted when we don’t know who performed the action or when it is obvious who performed the action. El Tiempo is red all over Colombia.
