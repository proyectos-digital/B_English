These verbs cannot be understood based upon the meanings of the individual parts in isolation, but rather they have to be taken as a whole. Phrasal verbs that include a preposition are known as  #[strong prepositional verbs] and phrasal verbs that include a particle are also known as  #[strong particle verbs].
