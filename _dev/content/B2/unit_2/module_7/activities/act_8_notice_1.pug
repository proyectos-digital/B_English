                p(class="ta-r u-fz09") When we report yes/no questions we use “#[strong.u-textColor_3 if]” or #[strong.u-textColor_3 “whether”]. The tense of the verb changes as it does in reported speech but we don´t use auxiliary verbs. The word order is the same as in an affirmative sentence.
                p(class="ta-r u-fz09") When there is a #[strong.u-textColor_3 questions word] (what, where, why, who, when, how) we use that questions word in the reported questions but there is no auxiliary verb and the word order is like an affirmative sentence.
