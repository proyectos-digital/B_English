                            li • In quoted or direct speech, someone’s exact words are repeated. Quotation marks enclose his or her words. Example: Andrés said “I want to live in Manizales.”
                            li • In reported speech, someone’s words are described using said. No quotation marks are used. Some changes are made: - If the original statement is in the present, the verb is changed to the past. Pronouns or possessive adjectives change person.
                            li #[strong: span(class="u-textColor_5-dark") • Example:] “I want to live in Manizales”. #[br] Andres said that he #[strong wanted] to live in Manizales If the original statement is in the past, often the verb is not changed. Pronouns or possessive adjectives change person.
                            li #[strong: span(class="u-textColor_5-dark") • Example:] “I wanted to live in Manizales”. #[br] Andres said #[strong he wanted] to live in Manizales. If the original statement is in the present perfect, the verb changes to the past perfect. Pronouns or possessive adjectives change person
                            li #[strong: span(class="u-textColor_5-dark") • Example:] “I have studied in Pereira for three years.” #[br] Andres said that he #[strong had studied] in Pereira for three years. #[strong Commands] are formed using the #[strong to-infinitive] in statements and #[strong not + to-infinitive] in negative statements. If we report somebody’s #[strong commands], we use the verb #[strong told]. If it’s a #[strong request], the word used in the main clause is usually #[strong asked].
                            li #[strong: span(class="u-textColor_5-dark") • Example:] Please, be quiet. #[br] Andres asked me to be quiet. #[br] When we report yes/no questions we use ‘if’ or ‘whether’. The tense of the verb changes as it does in reported speech but we don’t use auxiliary verbs. The word order is the same as in an affirmative sentence.
                            li #[strong: span(class="u-textColor_5-dark") • Example:] “Are you coming to the meeting?” #[br] Andres asked me if I was coming to the meeting. #[br] When there is a #[strong question word] (what, where, why, who, when, how) we use that question word in the reported question but there is no auxiliary verb and the word order is like an affirmative sentence.
                            li #[strong: span(class="u-textColor_5-dark") • Example:] “Where do you live?” Andres asked #[strong me where I lived].
