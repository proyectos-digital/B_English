                                p I had a very nice meal at El Carmelo restaurant. The food was lovely – delicious and full of flavor. The only disappointment was the dessert – the apple pie was far too sweet and it was cold too. We chose to eat in the garden which was full of beautiful flowers and very relaxing. The service was quite good but as we were in the garden it was more difficult to find a waiter when we wanted to order something. Apart from that it was an enjoyable evening. As for the price – what a bargain, excellent value for money!

                                p The best thing about Sassones was the service, it was excellent. There was a warm welcome when we arrived and the staff was very helpful all evening. The food was good. The menu was interesting. I ordered a curry which was very delicious and had a lot of flavors. Then when we had coffee at the end. It’s quite a nice room, with black and white photographs of famous people on the walls. It’s not cheap, but it is not expensive either.

                                p I went to Caramillo because I wanted a romantic meal with my wife – what a mistake! The music playing was horrible and very loud too. There were no candles; the place was full of bright, flashing lights! The food was average, nothing special at all. My wife’s chocolate cake was tasty but I had a lemon tart which was far too sour. Our waitress never noticed when our glasses were empty and we had to wait over half an hour for the bill. It wasn’t expensive but as the food wasn’t great I’m glad I didn’t have to pay any more.
