                p(class="ta-r") Look at tense examples:
                p(class="ta-r") Two weeks ago, there was a conflicto in the classroom: Daniel acussed Rodrigo of cheating in the test. When they talked to the teacher, Rodrigo apologized for copying the answers from a student next to him. 
                p(class="ta-r") The teacher reprimanded him and aproved of repeating the test. All the students blamed Rodrigo for doing this. A week later, all the students were concentrated on studying for this second chance. They insisted on doing the exams in groups but the teacher kept on telling them that this was an individual test.  When the teacher gave them the results, he congratulated them for writing a long essay and everybody completed the task satisfactorily.
